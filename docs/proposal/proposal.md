Hi, my name is Daniel Choi. I am a senior at the University of Massachusetts: Amherst and majoring in Computer Science. I am currently working part time for a healthcare company called [McKesson](http://www.mckesson.com/). I have worked with mainly Java and C# programs but I am also really excited to be trying out web programming for the first time.

If you would like to contact me, here is my [email](mailto:dchoi@umass.edu).


### Robert Hromada

Other Courses: Philosophy 334&360, (almost done with Philosophy minor)

Good day all I'm Robert Hromada but many people call me Pippin or Pip.  Im a senior AI compsci major and this class should be awesome for me to not only learn JavaScript and web development but enforce my skill in group developing.  I have classes all day till this class on Tuesdays and Thursdays but I am free on the other 3 days (weekends sometimes).  Most of my skill is in the develompent and structuring aspects of making a project not so much the hard coding so I hope to utilize those skills in this team.


### Sean Kelley

CS Courses : 121, 187, 220, 230, 240, 250, 377, 311, 453

Other Courses: Linear Algebra

Hi I'm Sean, I'm a senior here at UMass. Mostly experienced with languages taught here at school(java/C++) but have worked in many other languages on many occasions. Time to add javascript to that list.... I check my Gmail (Seankly@gmail.com) all the time, so if you want to find me, thats the place.


### David Su

CS Courses: 121, 187, 220, 230, 240, 250, 377, 311, 383, 453

Other Courses: Comparative Politics, Anthropology

Hello everyone, I'm David. I'm a Senior majoring in Computer Science and I'm looking forward to working with you all this semester. I have some experience with Java, Javascript, SQL, and other languages so perhaps my job will be either coding the application or setting up the server and databases on the back end. Although I don't have much experience with the latter, I'd certainly be more than happy to research and set it up if need be.

Hello, my name is Yue Shing. I am a senior majoring in Computer Science. Most of my coding experience is with Java and C++. I've wanted to take a web programming course for a while, so I'm happy to meet and work with you guys this semester.


### Colby Stone

I have been a web designer for 8+ years. I have worked for design companies and have had my own web design company. I came back to school to get my degree in computer science and further my skills to become more of a web developer rather than just a designer. I am now in my last semester and will graduate in December.


### Mike Turley

CS Courses: 121, 187, 220, 230, 240, 250, 305, 311, 320, 377, 383, 445, 453, 491IP(current), 585(current)

Other Courses: PHYSICS 151, Linear Algebra

Hi, my name is Mike and I'm a senior Computer Science major here at UMass Amherst.  I have been a freelance web developer off and on since high school, and I took an extended break between my sophomore and junior years of college to work.  While most of my experience is in full-stack web development, I have also worked on mobile and desktop applications as well as some systems programming.  My favorite language is JavaScript, of course, but mostly for its entertainment value.  I also enjoy Python, Ruby, and occasionally Java and C/C++.  This past summer, I was an intern on Amazon's AWS Storage Gateway team.  I will be graduating this February.
