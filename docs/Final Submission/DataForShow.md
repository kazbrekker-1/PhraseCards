# Overview
<p>
Phrase Cards is an interactive free-to-play multiplayer web app. The game is centered around filling in an incomplete story. The players submit words to the "card czar" who chooses which word given is used to fill in the story. The card czar is a role which changes every turn, so every player gets a chance to create the story, using their favorite submitted word given by the others.

Phrase Cards started as a (noun) of Cards Against Humanity, but after realizing that game was (adjective), we decided to combine it with MadLibs to make our project (Awesome)!

The application presents a user friendly gui, a playing area with real-time updates, personal profile page with a friends list, search functionality for other players profiles and an in-game chat room.  Our back end development uses MongoDB to store user data, game state and structured story data, and shares this data with the client via AJAX and Socket.IO implementations.

# Problems
- Early on, everyone had different visions of how the game was supposed to be played out.
- Delegation of Team Responsibilities

#### what i put for slides
- Team members took different directions on how game would be played out.
- Delegation of work was low in beginning which lead to too much catchup later in development
- Absenteeism from class and group meeting lead to some members lack of understanding
- Massiveness of project and libraries was difficult to learn

# Not Implemented
- Card Against Humanity
- Did not implement our own avatar feature. We used Gravatar instead.

#### what i put for slides
- Cards against Humanity style game was re-visioned into mad-lib style game
- Implementing our own logo/avatar feature was abandoned for Gravatar web-service

# Future Work
- Custom Stories (Player Submitted Stories)
- Different Game Modes
- Profanity Filter
- Vast Database of Stories

# What we need
- Title and logo
