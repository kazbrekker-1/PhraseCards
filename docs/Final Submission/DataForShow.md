# Overview
<p>
Phrase Cards started as a (noun) of Cards Against Humanity, but after realizing that game was (adjective), we decided to combine it with MadLibs to make our project (Awesome)!
In Phrase Cards, up to 4 players complete to see who is the (adjective-est) ad-libber by having their submissions for each fill-in voted on by their peers.

# Problems
- Early on, everyone had different visions of how the game was supposed to be played out.
- Delegation of Team Responsibilities

#### what i put for slides
- Team members took different directions on how game would be played out.
- Delegation of work was low in beginning which lead to too much catchup later in development
- Absenteeism from class and group meeting lead to some members lack of understanding
- Massiveness of project and libraries was difficult to learn

# Not Implemented
- Card Against Humanity
- Did not implement our own avatar feature. We used Gravatar instead.

#### what i put for slides
- Cards against Humanity style game was re-visioned into mad-lib style game
- Implementing our own logo/avatar feature was abandoned for Gravatar web-service

# Future Work
