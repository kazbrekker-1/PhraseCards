# Problems
- Early on, everyone had different visions of how the game was supposed to be played out.
- Delegation of Team Responsibilities

#### what i put for slides
- Team members took different directions on how game would be played out.
- Delegation of work was low in beginning which lead to too much catchup later in development
- Absenteeism from class and group meeting lead to some members lack of understanding
- Massiveness of project and libraries was difficult to learn

# Not Implemented
- Card Against Humanity
- Did not implement our own avatar feature. We used Gravatar instead.

#### what i put for slides
- Cards against Humanity style game was re-visioned into mad-lib style game
- Implementing our own logo/avatar feature was abandoned for Gravatar web-service

# Future Work
- Custom Stories (Player Submitted Stories)
- Different Game Modes
- Profanity Filter
- Vast Database of Stories

# What we need
- Title and logo
- Team members and what they did
- Bird's eye view (application structure and design)
- Commercial?
- screancast of these slides
- Video2: voice and video of sorse code
