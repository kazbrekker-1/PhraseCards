### Scenarios

1. The user will come to the home page which will display snippets of the game and a login/sign up prompt. 
2. The user can sign up in which they are prompted with a window asking to provide their email address, a password, and perhaps other information.
3. The user can then login and will then be brought to the lobby.
4. The lobby page will present a list of their online friends, a button to join a random game, create a room with their friends, view their past games, or a leaderboard of the community's favorite madlibs stories.
5. Pressing the create room buttom will prompt the user to invite friends to his room and have a button to search for a game/players if the room isn't full or a button to start the game.
6. After pressing the search for game/players buttons, the room will wait while the search commences for potential joiners.
7. When the game starts the players will see a page where those present will appear in a list, a chat window, and a line for them to make their story. The Card Czar will begin at random and the game will commence. 
8. The first round will consist of everyone but the Card Czar choosing a word to fit a blank of the line and the Card Czar will choose his/her favorite. 
9. The Card Czar will shift to another player and the game will continue in this manner until the story is complete and is shown or perhaps will always be shown to the players. 
10. After the game ends, the players will be left in the game room to chat or have the option to return to the lobby and look for a new game.
