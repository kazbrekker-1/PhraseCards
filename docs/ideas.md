Me and Dsu have run this at various parties, and it's always a hit. http://derailedtelephonepictionary.wordpress.com/what-is-telephone-pictionary/ for the rules (Sean + DSu)


 Pippin vote-  I like Daniel's idea as well as the original mad lib idea

 Yue- I like the Telephone Pictionary and PostShowConversations ideas. I don't really mind doing either one so I'll put my vote toward the one with more votes at the end.
