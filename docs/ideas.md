#### * We will vote on Sat. 9-27


- PostShowConversations - a place for tv viewers to discuss episodes of tv shows. (Colby)
- gameHelpForum - a site that helps or gives suggestions on how to help or improve game expirience (Pippin)
- lifeTracker - web app that times what you have done everyday and makes stats on it. (Daniel)

-Telephone Pictionary - A combination of the two popular party games Pictionary and Telephone, best for 4 or more players. 
Me and Dsu have run this at various parties, and it's always a hit. http://derailedtelephonepictionary.wordpress.com/what-is-telephone-pictionary/ for the rules (Sean + DSu)


 Pippin vote-  I like Daniel's idea as well as the original mad lib idea

 Yue- I like the Telephone Pictionary and PostShowConversations ideas. I don't really mind doing either one so I'll put my vote toward the one with more votes at the end.
 
 Mike- I really like the Telephone Pictionary idea, particularly the implications of doing drawings and pushing them around to players.  Maybe we can do something crazy with HTML5 canvas + mouse events + sockets to make it so you can view someone else's drawing in real time?  I also feel like PostShowConversations and GameHelpForum are just specialized instances of a web forum, of which there are already several implementations out there.  LifeTracker is interesting too, I'm curious about how that might work.  Also happy with the original mad libs idea as well.
