<p>Good day all I'm Robert Hromada but many people call me Pippin or Pip.  Im a senior AI compsci major and this class should be awesome for me to not nly learn JavaScript and web development but enforce my skill in group developing.  I have classes all day till this class on Tuesdays and Thursdays but I am free on the other 3 days (weekends sometimes).  Most of my skill is in the develompent and structuring aspects of making a project not so much the hard coding so I hope to utilize those skills in this team.  </p>

<p>I have been a web designer for 8+ years. I have worked for design companies and have had my own web design company. I came back to school to get my degree in computer science and further my skills to become more of a web developer rather than just a designer. I am now in my last semester and will graduate in December.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Mike and I'm a senior Computer Science major here at UMass Amherst.  I have been a freelance web developer off and on since high school, and I took an extended break between my sophomore and junior years of college to work.  While most of my experience is in full-stack web development, I have also worked on mobile and desktop applications as well as some systems programming.  My favorite language is JavaScript, of course, but mostly for its entertainment value.  I also enjoy Python, Ruby, and occasionally Java and C/C++.  This past summer, I was an intern on Amazon's AWS Storage Gateway team.  I will be graduating this February.</p>
