- Finish filling in helpers and templates for all views of the game (mini story, end area, review area, etc)
- Tighten up the GameManager:
  - let game proceed if all players have submitted a word
  - make game wait if nobody has submitted a word
  - if the card czar doesn't select a winning word, select one at random
- Pretty up views, make everything really clearly usable
- Playtest the game
