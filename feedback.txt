Project 1:
Really cool idea and I am looking forward to seeing this project unfold over the course of the semester. 
The team logo looks great and is simple but very effective.

I'd like to see a bit more activity on the Trello board as it is a requirement for the course.

Project 2:
Its good to see you guys are willing to alter your first idea after finding another site that performs a similar
function to what you originally had in mind. However, team members don't seem to relate their outside courses to
the project or address any sort of problem statement.

Good job using git properly, and its good to see you guys are actively utilizing Trello and meeting regularly,
keep it up! Frequent meetings and collaberation between group members is vital to succeeding in the course.
[Thumbs Up]
