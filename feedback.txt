Project 1:
Really cool idea and I am looking forward to seeing this project unfold over the course of the semester. 
The team logo looks great and is simple but very effective.

I'd like to see a bit more activity on the Trello board as it is a requirement for the course.
[Thumbs Up]

Project 2:
Its good to see you guys are willing to alter your first idea after finding another site that performs a similar
function to what you originally had in mind. However, team members don't seem to relate their outside courses to
the project or address any sort of problem statement.

Good job using git properly, and its good to see you guys are actively utilizing Trello and meeting regularly,
keep it up! Frequent meetings and collaberation between group members is vital to succeeding in the course.

Project 3:
The webpage layout looks really good, I like the colors and simplicity of it all. A few things I am questioning are:
    - Are you going to have a landing page explaining what the application is? If someone is just greeted with 
      "Sign up to play!" you're going to turn users away.
    - The "New Game" button appears twice in some cases and its not as obvious as to what the lobbies are, are these
      lobbies of your friends? Public lobbies? is there going to be a button that just instantly matches you with strangers?
Just a few nitpicks here, what you have so far is looking great, but don't be afraid to iterate on it over time.

Your trello board activity has been great, keep it up!
[Thumbs Up]
